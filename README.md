# Bear Core

Bear Core is a simple mod that simple makes it so you can only sleep a little each night, prevents enderman from picking up most blocks, and prevents usage of bone meal. All mod ideas were by Bear989([twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/bear989), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Bear989)), and credit goes to @Speiger for coding the mod on previous versions of mc.
