# Bear Core

Bear Core is a hardcore play-through extension that prevents essential needs.
Sleeping is extremely nerfed, you can now only progress the night by a small amount instead of sleepng till day.
Bonemeal is now useless for food growing (mods included), so plan your food farms out well.

For those which build dirt/grass huts, good news enderman can no longer deconstruct them.
Providing at least some mercy to the people.

All mod ideas were by Bear989([twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/bear989), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Bear989)), and credit goes to @Speiger for coding the mod on previous versions of mc.
